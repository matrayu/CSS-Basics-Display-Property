Assignment
In this exercise, you'll have to use your knowledge of the display property to achieve the layout specified in the design files below.

Fork this repl.it. We've given you starter index.html and main.css files. To complete this exercise, you'll need to modify both the HTML and CSS.

Requirements
Fork this repl.it, and start coding up the design. Remember, click and drag the bar separating the Editor from the Output to the left to see how the designs look in a full browser window.

Use the display property (and any other required properties) to write CSS rules that accomplish the design above. Remember, don't set the display property for all elements. Remember that elements have default display values, and you should only override them when you have a specific reason to (and to be clear, you will need to explicitly set display values in at least one style rule for this exercise).
Submit a link below to the repl.it. When you submit your project link, your mentor will be notified to check out your work.

Limit yourself to thirty minutes for this exercise. If you can't complete it by then have a look at the solution below, and even if you do complete it within thirty minutes, still have a look and compare your code to the solution below.
Note that in order to get the box containing the colored boxes to horizontally center, you'll need to use one of the strategies from the previous reading on horizontal alignment.

Solution
Don't look at this solution until you've tried for at least thirty minutes working on your own:
